This is a  food ordering app for our college night canteen with real time order updates, payment integration, google login and a responsive design. 
Customer Side- A customer upon landing on to the website can choose whichever food they want  from the menu list. After going on to the cart they can order the food if they are already logged in, else they would be redirected to login page where they can login through OAuth. Now after  clicking on Order Now button, user would be redirected to Paytm JS Checkout Page and after doing payment, they would be redirected to previous orders page from where they can check their order status.
Mess Staff Page- Mess personnel can see the pending orders and pending item count , and on the control menu can change the menu availibility,name and price. On special controls page, add the item ,reset order count, can resume booking or stop booking.

Landing Page for Customer:
